What would I like to have in my gem?

1. It should scrap data from https://slickdeals.net/deals/
2. It should display all the deals on first page with index no. - which will be the list of popular deals today.
3. It should ask user for input if they would like to see details of any deal.
4. It should show more description on any deal that user may be interested in.
5. It should ask user again for input if they are interested in any deal or if they would like to see list of deals.
6. It should show user what they are interested in.
7. If user select to exit, it should exit.
